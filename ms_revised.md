**Abstract**: Community ecology is tasked with the considerable challenge
of predicting the structure, and properties, of emerging ecosystems. It
requires the ability to understand how and why species interact, as this
will allow the development of mechanism-based predictive models, and as
such to better characterize how ecological mechanisms act locally on the
existence of inter-specific interactions. Here we argue that the current
conceptualization of species interaction networks is ill-suited for this
task. Instead, we propose that future research must start to account for the
intrinsic variability of interaction networks. This can be accompslihed simply
by recognizing that there exists intra-specific variability, in traits or
properties related to the establishment of species interactions. By shifting
the scale towards population-based processes, we show that this new approach
will improve our predictive ability and mechanistic understanding of how
species interact over large spatial or temporal scales.

# Introduction

Interactions between species are the driving force behind ecological dynamics
within communities [@ber09b]. Likely for this reason more than any, the
structure of communities have been described by species interaction networks
for over a century [@dun06]. Formally an ecological network is a mathematical
and conceptual representation of both *species*, and the *interactions*
they establish. Behind this conceptual framework is a rich and expanding
literature whose primary focus has been to quantify how numerical and
statistical properties of networks relate to their robustness [@dun02],
productivity [@duf07], or tolerance to extinction [@mem04]. Although
this approach classically focused on food webs [@ing09a], it has proved
particularly successful because it can be applied equally to all types of
ecological interactions [@kef12].

This body of literature generally assumes that, short of changes in local
densities due to ecological dynamics, networks are inherently *static*
objects. This assumption calls into question the relevance of network
studies at biogeographic scales. More explicitly, if two species are known
to interact at one location, it is often assumed that they will interact
whenever and wherever they co-occur [see *e.g.* @hav92]; this neglects the
fact that local environmental conditions, species states, and community
composition can intervene in the realization of interactions. More recently,
however, it has been established that networks are *dynamic* objects that
have structured variation in $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ diversity,
not only with regard to the change of species composition at different
locations but also to the fact that the same species will interact in
different ways over time or across their area of co-occurrence [@poi12b]. Of
these sources of variation in networks, the change of species composition
has been addressed explicitly in the context of networks [@gra11d;@dat13]
and within classical meta-community theory. However, because this literature
still tends to assume that interactions happen consistently between species
wherever they co-occur, it is ill-suited to address network variation as a
whole and needs be supplemented with new concepts and mechanisms.

Within the current paradigm, interactions are established between species
and are an immutable "property" of a species pair. Starting from empirical
observations, expert knowledge, or literature surveys, one could collect
a list of interactions for any given species pool. Several studies used
this approach to extrapolate the structure of networks over time and space
[@hav92;@pie08;@bai12] by considering that the network at *any* location
is composed of *all* of the potential interactions known for this species
pool. This stands in stark contrast with recent results showing that
(i) the identities of interacting species vary over space and (ii) the
dissimilarity of interactions is not related to the dissimilarity in species
composition [@poi12b]. The current conceptual and operational tools to study
networks therefore leaves us poorly equipped to understand the causes of this
variation. In this paper, we propose a general research agenda to understand
the mechanisms involved in the variability of species interactions.

In contrast to the current paradigm, we propose that future research on
interaction networks be guided by the following principle: the existence
of an interaction between two species is the result of a stochastic process
involving (i) local traits distributions, (ii) local abundances, and (iii)
higher-order effects by the local environment or species acting "at a distance"
on the interaction; regionally, the observation of interactions results of
the accumulation of local observations. This approach is outlined in **Box
1**. Although this proposal is a radical yet intuitive change in the way we
think about ecological network structure, we demonstrate in this paper that it
is well supported by empirical and theoretical results alike. Furthermore, our
new perspective is well placed to open the door to novel predictive approaches
integrating a range of key ecological mechanisms. Notably, we propose in
**Box 2** that this approach facilitates the study of indirect interactions,
for which predictive approaches have long proved elusive [@tac11a].

Since the next generation of predictive biogeographic models will need to
account for species interactions [@thu13], it is crucial not to underestimate
the fact that these interactions are intrinsically variable and exhibit
a geographic variability of their own. Indeed, investigating the impact
of species interactions on species distributions only makes sense under
the implicit assumption that species interactions themselves vary over
biogeographical scales. Models of species distributions will therefore increase
their predictive potential if they account for the variability of ecological
interactions. In turn, tighter coupling between species-distribution and
interaction-distribution models will provide mode accurate predictions
of the properties of emerging ecosystems [@gil10a;@est11] and the spatial
variability of properties between existing ecosystems. By paying more attention
to the variability of species interactions, the field of biogeography will be
able to re-visit classical observations typically explained by species-level
mechanisms; for example, how does community complexity and function vary along
latitudinal gradients, is there information hidden in the co-occurrence or
avoidance of species interactions, etc. This predictive effort is made all
the more important as both the phenology **PARMESAN07** and ranges [@dev12]
of species occupying different positions in their interactions networks
are affected differently by climate change. Predicting that species
will move and change while interactions remain the same is probably a very
conservative approach to estimating the changes to come, and building explicitly
on biological mechanisms is one possible way to overcome this limitation.

In this paper, we outline the mechanisms that are involved in the variability
of species interactions over time, space, and environmental gradients. We
discuss how they will affect the structure of ecological networks, and
how these mechanisms can be integrated into new predictive and statistical
models (**Box 1**). Most importantly, we show that this approach integrates
classical community ecology thinking and biogeographic questions (**Box 2**)
and will ultimately result in a better understanding of the structure of
ecological communities.

# The dynamic nature of ecological interaction networks

Recent studies on the sensitivity of network structure to environmental
change provide some context for the study of dynamic networks. @men12a
showed that the structure of a plant–frugivore network changed along a
forest–farmland gradient. At the edges between two habitats, species were
on average less specialized and interacted more evenly with a larger number
of partners than they did in habitat cores. Differences in network structure
have also been observed within forest strata that differ in their proximity
to the canopy and visitation by birds [@sch11a]. @tyl07
reports a *stronger* signal of spatial interaction turnover when working with
quantitative rather than binary interactions, highlighting the importance
of *measuring* rather than assuming (or simply reporting) the existence
of interactions. @eve07 demonstrated that outbreaks of the spruce
budworm were associated with changes in the structure of its trophic network,
both in terms of species observed and their interactions. @poi11b used a
microbial system of hosts and pathogens to study the impact of productivity
gradients on realized infection; when the species were moved from high
to medium to low productivity, some interactions were lost and others were
gained. As a whole, these results suggest that the existence, and properties,
of an interaction are not only contingent on the presence of the two species
involved but may also require particular environmental conditions, including
the presence or absence of species not directly involved in the interaction.

We argue here that there are three broadly-defined classes of mechanisms
that ultimately determine the realization of species interactions. First,
individuals must be in high enough local relative abundances to meet;
this is the so-called "neutral" perspective of interactions. Second, there
must be phenological or trait matching between individuals, such that an
interaction will actually occur given that the encounter takes place. Finally,
the realization of an interaction is regulated by the interacting organisms'
surroundings and should be studied in the context of indirect interactions.

# Population dynamics and neutral processes

Over the recent years, the concept of neutral dynamics has left a clear
imprint on the analysis of ecological network structure, most notably
in bipartite networks [@blu06]. Re-analysis of several host–parasite
datasets, for example, showed that changes in local species abundances
triggers variation in parasite specificity [@vaz05b]. More generally,
it is possible to predict the structure of trophic interactions [@can12]
and host-parasite communities [@can14] given only minimal assumptions about
the distribution of species abundance. In this section, we review recent
studies investigating the consequences of neutral dynamics on the structure
of interaction networks and show how variations in population size can lead
directly to interaction turnover.

## The basic processes

As noted previously, for an interaction to occur between individuals from two
populations, these individuals must first meet, then interact. Assuming that
two populations occupy the same location and are active at the same time of
the day/year, then the likelihood of an interaction is roughly proportional to
the product of their relative abundance [@vaz07]. This means that individuals
from two large populations are more likely to interact than individuals from
two small populations, simply because they tend to meet more often. This
approach can also be extended to the prediction of interaction strength
[@blu06;@vaz07], *i.e.* how strong the consequences of the interaction
will be. The neutral perspective predicts that locally-abundant species
should have more partners and that locally-rare species should appear more
specialized. In a purely neutral model (*i.e.* interactions happen entirely
by chance, although the determinants of abundance can still be non-neutral),
the identities of species do not matter, and it becomes easy to understand
how the structure of local networks can vary since species vary regionally
in abundance. @can12 proposed the term of "neutrally forbidden links"
to refer to interactions that are phenologically feasible but not realized
because of the underlying population size distribution. The identity of
these neutrally forbidden links will vary over time and space, either due to
stochastic changes in population sizes or because population size responds
deterministically (*i.e.* non-neutrally) to extrinsic drivers.

## Benefits for network analysis

It is important to understand how local variations in abundance,
whether neutral or not, cascade up to affect the structure of interaction
networks. One approach is to use simple statistical models to quantify the
effect of population sizes on local interaction occurrence or strength [see
*e.g.* @kri08]. These models can be extended to remove the contribution of
neutrality to link strength, allowing us to work directly on the interactions
as they are determined by traits (**Box 1**). Doing so allows us to compare
the variation of neutral and non-neutral components of network structure
over space and time. To achieve this goal, however, it is essential that
empirical interaction networks (i) are replicated and (ii) include independent
measurements of population sizes.

An additional benefit of such sampling is that these data will also help
refine neutral theory. @woo05b made the point that deviations of empirical
communities from neutral predictions were most often explained by species
trophic interactions which are notoriously, albeit intentionally, absent
from the original formulation of the theory [@hub01]. Merging the two views
will increase our explanatory power, and provide new ways to test neutral
theory in interactive communities; it will also offer a new opportunity,
namely to complete the integration of network structure with population
dynamics. To date, most studies have focused on the effects of a species'
position within a food web on the dynamics of its biomass or abundance
[@bro06c; @ber09b; @sto11b; @saa11a]. Adopting this neutral perspective
brings things full circle since the abundance of a species will also dictate
its position in the network: changes in abundance can lead to interactions
being gained or lost, and these changes in abundance are in part caused by
existing interactions (**Box 2**). For this reason, there is a potential
to link species and interaction dynamics and, more importantly, to do so
in a way which accounts for the interplay between the two. From a practical
point of view, this requires repeated sampling of a system through time, so
that changes in relative abundances can be related to changes in interaction
strength [@yea12]. Importantly, embracing the neutral view will force us to
reconsider the causal relationship between resource dynamics and interaction
strength since, in a neutral context, both are necessarily interdependent.

# Traits matching in space and time

Once individuals meet, whether they will interact is widely thought to be
the product of an array of behavioral, phenotypic, and cultural aspects that
can conveniently be referred to as a "trait-based process". Two populations
can interact when their traits values allow it, *e.g.* viruses are able to
overcome host resistance, predators can capture the preys, trees provide
enough shading for shorter grasses to grow. Non-matching traits will
effectively prevent the existence of an interaction, as demonstrated by
@ole11. Under this perspective, the existence of interactions can
be mapped onto trait values, and interaction networks will consequently
vary along with variation in local trait distribution. In this section,
we review how trait-based processes impact network structure, how they can
create variation, and the perspective they open for an evolutionary approach.

## The basic processes

There is considerable evidence that, at the species level, interaction partners
are selected on the grounds of matching trait values. Random networks built on
these rules exhibit realistic structural properties [@wil00; @sto05]. Trait
values, however, vary from population to population within species; it is
therefore expected that the local interactions will be contingent upon traits
spatial distribution (\autoref{f:traits}). The fact that a species' niche can
appear large if it is the aggregation of narrow but differentiated individual
or population niches is now well established [@dev10;@bol03] and has also
reinforced the need to understand intra-specific trait variation to describe
the structure and dynamics of communities [@woo10; @bol11]. Nevertheless,
this notion has yet to percolate into the literature on network structure
despite its most profound consequence: a species appearing generalist at
the regional scale can easily be specialized in *each* of the patches it
occupies. This reality has long been recognized by functional ecologists,
which are now increasingly predicting the *variance* in traits of different
populations within a species [@vio12].

Empirically, there are several examples of intraspecific trait variation
resulting in extreme interaction turnover. A particularly spectacular example
was identified by @ohb11 who describes how a giant waterbug is able to get hold
of, and eventually consume, juveniles from a turtle species. This interaction
can only happen when the turtle is small enough for the morphotraits of the
bug to allow it to consume the turtle, and as such will vary throughout the
developmental cycle of both species. @cho12 demonstrated through behavioral
assays that prey which evaded predation when young were more likely to consume
juvenile predators than the "naive" individuals; their past interactions
shaped behavioral traits that alter the network structure over time. These
examples show that trait-based effects on networks can be observed even in the
absence of genotypic variation (although we discuss this in the next section).

From a trait-based perspective, the existence of an interaction is an
emergent property of the trait distribution of local populations: variations
in one or both of these distributions, regardless of the mechanism involved
(development, selection, plasticity, environment), are likely to alter the
interaction. Importantly, when interaction-driving traits are subject to
environmental forcing (for example, body size is expected to be lower in
warm environments, @ang04), there can be covariation between environmental
conditions and the occurrence of interactions. @woo12 used macrocosms to
experimentally demonstrate that changes in food-web structure happen at the
same time as changes in species body mass distribution. Integrating trait
variation over gradients will provide more predictive power to models of
community response to environmental change.

## Benefits for network analysis

Linking spatial and temporal trait variation with network variation will help
identify the mechanistic basis of network dissimilarity. From a sampling point
of view, having enough data requires that, when interactions are recorded,
they are coupled with trait measurements. Importantly, these measurements
cannot merely be extracted from a reference database because interactions
are driven by *local* trait values and their matching across populations
from different species. Within our overarching statistical framework
(**Box 1**), we expect that (i) network variability at the *regional*
scale will be dependent on the variation of populations' traits, and (ii)
variation between any series of networks will depend on the *covariance*
between species traits. Although it requires considerably larger quantities
of data to test, this approach should allow us to infer *a priori* network
variation. This next generation of data will also help link variation of
network structure to variation of environmental conditions. @pri03 shows how
specific biomechanical responses to water input in shrubs can have pleiotropic
effects on traits involved in the interaction with insects. In this system,
the difference in network structure can be explained because (i) trait values
determine the existence of an interaction, and (ii) environmental features
determine trait values.  We have little doubt that future empirical studies
will provide similar mechanistic narratives.

At larger temporal scales, the current distribution of traits also reflects
past evolutionary history [@din08]. Recognizing this important fact offers
an opportunity to approach the evolutionary dynamics and variation of
networks. Correlations between different species' traits, and between traits
and fitness, drive coevolutionary dynamics [@gom00;@nui03a]. Both of these
correlations vary over space and time [@tho05a], creating patchiness in the
processes and outcomes of coevolution. Trait structure and trait correlations
are also disrupted by migration [@gan08;@bur09]. Ultimately, understanding of
how ecological and evolutionary trait dynamics affect network structure will
provide a mechanistic basis for the historical signal found in contemporary
network structures [@rez07; @ekl11; @bas11a; @sto12].

# Beyond direct interactions

In this section, we argue that, although networks are built around observations
of direct interactions like predation or pollination, they also offer a
compelling tool with which to address indirect effects on the existence and
strength of interactions. Any direct interaction arises from the "physical"
interaction of only two species, and, as we have already detailed, these can
be modified by local relative abundances and/or species traits.  Indirect
interactions, on the other hand, are established through the involvement
of another party than the two focal species, either through cascading
effects (herbivorous species compete with insect laying eggs on plants) or
through physical mediation of the environment (bacterial exudates increase
the bio-availability of iron for all bacterial species; plants with large
foliage provide shade for smaller species).  As we discuss in this section,
the fact that many (if not all) interactions are indirectly affected by the
presence of other species (i) has relevance for understanding the variation
of interaction network structure and (ii) can be studied within the classical
network-theory formalism.

## The basic processes

Biotic interactions themselves interact [@gol11]; in other words,
interactions are contingent on the occurrence of species other than those
interacting. Because the outcome of an interaction ultimately affects local
abundances (over ecological time scales) and population trait structure (over
evolutionary time scales), all interactions happening within a community
will impact one another. This does not actually mean pairwise approaches are
bound to fail, but it does clamor for a larger scale approach that accounts
for indirect effects.

The occurrence or absence of a biotic interaction can either affect either the
realization of other interactions (thus affecting the "interaction" component
of network $\beta$-diversity) or the presence of other species.  There are
several well-documented examples of one interaction allowing new interactions
to happen, *e.g.* opportunistic pathogens have a greater success of infection
in hosts which are already immunocompromised by previous infections, [@oli12a],
or conversely preventing them, *e.g.* a resident symbiont decreases the
infection probability of a new pathogen [@koc11;@hei03]. In both cases, the
driver of interaction turnover is the patchiness of species distribution;
the species acting as a "modifier" of the probability of interaction is
only partially present throughout the range of the other two species, thus
creating a mosaic of different interaction configurations. Variation in
interaction structure can happen through both cascading and environmental
effects: @sin04 show that caterpillars change the proportion of different
plant species in their diet when parasitized in order to favor low quality
items and load themselves with chemical compounds which are toxic for their
parasitoids. However, low quality food results in birds having a greater impact
on caterpillar populations [@sin12c]. It is noteworthy that in this example,
the existence of an interaction will affect both the strength, and impact, of
other interactions. In terms of their effects on network $\beta$-diversity,
indirect effects are thus likely to act on components of dissimilarity. A
common feature of the examples mentioned here is that pinpointing the exact
mechanism through which interactions affect each other often requires a good
working knowledge of the system's natural history.

## Benefits for network analysis

As discussed in previous sections, improved understanding of why and
where species interact should also provide a mechanistic understanding of
observed species co-occurrences. However, the presence of species is also
regulated by indirect interactions. Recent experimental results showed that
some predator species can only be maintained if another predator species
is present, since the latter regulates a competitively superior prey
and allows for prey coexistence [@san12]. These effects involving several
species and several types of interactions across trophic levels are complex
(and for this reason, have been deemed unpredictable in the past, @tac11a),
and can only be understood by comparing communities in which different
species are present/absent. Looking at figure \ref{f:meta}, it is also clear
that the probability of having an interaction between species $i$ and $j$
($\text{P}(\mathbf{L}_{ij})$) is ultimately constrained by the probability that
individuals of species $i$ and $j$ will meet assuming random movement, *i.e.*
$\text{P}(i \cap j)$. Thus, the existence of any ecological interaction will
be contingent upon *other* ecological interactions driving local co-occurrence
[@ara11]. Based on this argument, ecological networks cannot be limited to
a collection of pairwise interactions. Our view of them needs be updated to
account for the importance of the context surrounding these interactions
(**Box 2**). From a biogeographic standpoint, it requires us to develop
a theory based on interaction co-occurrence in addition to the current
knowledge encompassing only species co-occurrence. @ara11 and @all11a
introduced the idea that competitive interactions can leave a signal in
species co-occurrence network. A direct consequence of this result is that,
for example, trophic interactions are constrained by species' competitive
outcomes *before* they are ever constrained by *e.g.* predation-related
traits. In order to fully understand interactions and their indirect effects,
however, there is a need to develop new conceptual tools to *represent* effects
that interactions have on one another. In a graph theoretical perspective,
this would amount to establishing edges between pairs of edges, a task for
which there is limited conceptual or methodological background.

# Conclusions

Overall, we argue here that the notion of “species interaction networks”
shifts our focus away from the level of organization at which most of the
relevant biogeographic processes happen --- populations. In order to make
reliable predictions about the structure of networks, we need to understand
what triggers variability of ecological interactions. In this contribution,
we have outlined that there are several direct (abundance-based and trait-based)
and indirect (biotic modifiers, indirect effects of co-occurrence) effects to
account for. We expect that the relative importance of each of these factors
and how precisely they affect the probability of establishing an interaction
are likely system-specific; nonetheless, we have proposed a unified conceptual
approach to understand them better.

At the moment, the field of community ecology is severely data-limited
to tackle this perspective. Despite the existence of several spatially- or
temporally-replicated datasets [*e.g.* @sch11a ; @sch12a ; @men12a], it is rare
that all relevant information has been measured independently. It was recently
concluded, however, that even a reasonably small subset of data can be enough
to draw inferences at larger scales [@gra13a]. Paradoxically, as tempting as
it may be to sample a network in its entirety, the goal of establishing global
predictions might be better furthered by extremely-detailed characterization
of a more modest number of interactions [@rod13b]. Assuming that there
are indeed statistical invariants in the rules governing interactions,
this information will allow us to make verifiable predictions on the
structure of the networks. Better still, this approach has the potential to
substantially strengthen our understanding of the interplay between traits
and neutral effects. @blu08 claim that the impact of traits distribution on
network structure can be inferred simply by removing the impact of neutrality
(population densities), based on the idea that many rare links were instances
of sampling artifacts. As illustrated here (e.g, **Box 2**), their approach is
of limited generality, as the abundance of a species itself can be directly
driven by factors such as trait-environment matching. In addition, there are
virtually no datasets that follow a collection of interacting species through both
space *and* time in a replicated fashion. This type of data, although exceedingly
tedious to collect, would provide important indications of which mechanisms
should be explored to improve our understanding the variability of species interactions.

Assuming that suitable empirical data will inevitably accumulate in the coming years,
these approaches will rapidly expand our ability to predict the re-wiring
of networks under environmental change. The effect of environmental change
is expected to occur because (i) population sizes will be affected by the
change and (ii) either plastic or adaptive responses will shift or disrupt the
trait distributions. The framework proposed in **Box 1** predicts interaction
probabilities under different scenarios. Ultimately, being explicit about
the trait-abundance-interaction feedback will provide a better understanding
of short-term and long-term dynamics of interaction networks. We illustrate
this in Fig. \ref{f:synth}. The notion that population sizes have direct
effects on the existence of an interaction stands opposed to classical
consumer-resource theory, which is one of the bases of network analysis.
Considering this an opposition, however, is erroneous. Consumer-resource
theory considers a strong effect of abundance on the intensity of interactions
(**Box 2**), and itself is a source of (quantitative) variation. Furthermore,
these models are entirely determined by variations in population sizes in
the limiting case where the coefficient of interactions are similar. As
such, any approach seeking to understand the variation of interactions over
space ought to consider that local densities are not only a consequence,
but also a predictor, of the probability of observing an interaction. The
same reasoning can be held for local trait distributions, although over
micro-evolutionary time-scales. While trait values determine whether two
species are able to interact, they will be modified by the selective effect of
species interacting. Therefore, conceptualizing interactions as the outcome of
a probabilistic process regulated by local factors, as opposed to a constant,
offers the unprecedented opportunity to investigate feedbacks between different
time scales. This is especially important since all of the mechanisms mentioned
above are also likely to change rapidly over spatial scales. The situation in
which the phenologies of populations are synchronized locally but not regionally
[as shown by @sin12b] is an excellent example of when we must 
integrate these mechanisms into our interpretation of spatial and temporal
dynamics. 

Over the past decade, many insights have been gained by looking at the
turnover of different facets of biodiversity (taxonomic, functional, and
phylogenetic) through space [@mey11b;@dev10a]. Here, we propose that there
is another oft-neglected side of biodiversity: species interactions. The
perspective we bring forth allows us to unify these dimensions and offers us
the opportunity to describe the biogeographic structure of all components of
community and ecosystem structure simultaneously.

**Box 1: A mathematical framework for population-level interactions**

We propose that the occurrence (and intensity) of ecological interactions
at the population level relies on several factors, including relative local
abundances and local trait distributions. It is important to tease apart these
different factors so as to better disentangle neutral and niche processes. We
propose that these different effects can adequately be partitioned using
the model

$$\mathbf{A}_{ij} \propto \left[\mathcal{N}(i,j)\times\mathcal{T}(i,j)\right]+\epsilon \,,$$

where $\mathcal{N}$ is a function giving the probability that species $i$
and $j$ interact *based only on their local abundances* (that is, the
probability of encounter), and $\mathcal{T}$ is a function giving the *per
encounter* probability that species $i$ and $j$ interact *based on their
trait values*. The term $\epsilon$ accounts for all higher-order effects,
such as indirect interactions, local impact of environmental conditions on the
interaction, and impact of co-occurring species. Both of these functions can
take any form needed. In several papers, $\mathcal{N}(i,j)$ was expressed as
$\mathbf{n}_i\times \mathbf{n}_j$, where $\mathbf{n}$ is a vector of relative
abundances [@can14]. The expression of $\mathcal{T}$ can in most cases be
derived from mechanistic hypotheses about the observation. For example,
@gra13a used the niche model of @wil00 to predict interactions with the
simple rule that $\mathcal{T}(i,j) = 1$ if $i$ can consume $j$ based on
allometric rules, and $0$ otherwise. Following @roh10a, the expression of
$\mathcal{T}$ can be based on latent variables rather than actual trait
values. This simple formulation could be used to partition, at the level
of individual interactions, the relative importance of density-dependent
and trait-based processes using variance decomposition. Most importantly,
it predicts (i) how each of these components will vary over space and (ii)
how the structure of the network will be affected by, for example, changes in
local abundances or trait distributions. The results provided by this framework
will only be as good as the empirical data used, and there is a dire need for a
methodological discussion about how "predictor" variables (traits, population
sizes, etc.) should be measured in the field, in a way that is not biased by the
observation of the interactions. This will prove challenging for some types
of interactions; *e.g.* estimating the population size of parasites is often
contingent upon catching and examining hosts.
Understanding non-independence between
these variables in a system-specific way is a crucial point.

This model can further be extended in a spatial context, as

$$\mathbf{A}_{ijx} \propto \left[\mathcal{N}_x(i_x,j_x)\times\mathcal{T}_x(i_x,j_x)\right]+\epsilon_{ijx} \,,$$

in which $i_x$ is the population of species $i$ at site $x$. In this
formulation, the $\epsilon$ term could include the spatial variation of
interaction between $i$ and $j$ over sites, and the covariance between the
observed presence of this interaction and the occurrence of species $i$ and
$j$. This can, for example, help address situations in which the selection
of prey items is determined by traits, but also by behavioral choices. Most
importantly, this model differs from the previous one in that each site $x$
is characterized by a set of functions ${\mathcal{N}_x, \mathcal{T}_x}$
that may not be identical for all sites considered. For example, the same
predator may prefer different prey items in different locations, which will
require the use of a different form for $\mathcal{T}$ across the range of
locations. @gra13a show that it is possible to derive robust approximation
for the $\mathcal{T}$ function even with incomplete set of data, which gives
hope that this framework can be applied even when all species information
is not known at all sites (which would be an unrealistic requirement for
most realistic systems). Both of these models can be used to partition the
variance from existing data or to test which trait-matching function best
describes the observed interactions. They also provide a solid platform
for dynamical simulations in that they will allow re-wiring the interaction
network as a function of trait change and to generate simulations that are
explicit about the variability of interactions.

**Box 2: Population-level interactions in the classical modelling framework**

As noted in the main text, most studies of ecological networks---particularly
food webs---regard the adjacency matrix $\mathbf{A}$ as a fixed entity
that specifies observable interactions on the basis of whether two species
co-occur or not. Given this assumption, there is a lengthy history of trying to
understand how the strength or organization of these interactions influence
the dynamic behavior of species abundance [@may73]. Often,
such models take the form

$$\frac{dN_i(t)}{dt} = N_i(t) \left(a_i - \sum_{j \ne i} \alpha_{ij} A_{ij} N_j(t) \right) \,,$$

where $a_i$ is the growth rate of species $i$ (and could, in principle,
depend on other species' abundances $N$) and $\alpha_{ij}$ is the strength
of the effect of $j$ on $i$.  In this or just about any related model,
direct species-species interaction can influence species abundances but their
abundances *never* feedback and influence the *per capita* interaction coefficients $\alpha_{ij}$. They
do, however, affect the realized interactions, which are defined by
$\alpha_{ij} N_i(t) N_j(t)$, something which is also the case when considering
more complicated functional responses [@koe07].

More recently, there have been multiple attempts to approach the problem from
the other side. Namely, to understand how factors such as species'
abundance and/or trait distributions influence the occurrence of the
interactions themselves (**Box 1**). One potential drawback to that approach,
however, is that it still adopts the assumption that the observation of
any interaction $A_{ij}$ is only an explicit function of the properties of
species $i$ and $j$ (traits and co-occurrence).

Since dynamic models demonstrate quite clearly that non-interacting species can
alter each others' abundances (*e.g.* via apparent competition [@hol87]),
this is a deeply-ingrained inconsistency between the two approaches. Such
a simplification does increase the analytical tractability of the problem
[@all12a], but there is little, if any, guarantee that it is ecologically
accurate. In our opinion, the "higher-effects" term $\epsilon$ in the models
presented in **Box 1** is the one with the least straightforward expectations,
but it may also prove to be the most important if we wish to accurately
describe all of these indirect effects.

A similar problem actually arises in the typical statistical framework
for predicting interaction occurrence. Often, one attempts to "decompose"
interactions into the component that is explained by species' abundances and
the component explained by species' traits (e.g., Box 1). Just like how the
underlying functions $\mathcal{N}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ could vary across sites,
there could also be feedback between species' abundances and traits, in the
same way that we have outlined the feedback between interactions and species'
abundances. In fact, given the increasing evidence for the evolutionary role
of species-species interactions in explaining extant biodiversity and their
underlying traits [@jan82; @her02], a framework which assumes
relative independence of these different phenomenon is likely starting from
an overly-simplified perspective.

![An illustration of the metaweb concept. In its simplest form, a metaweb is the list of all possible species and interactions between them for the system being studied, at the regional level (far left side). Everything that is ultimately observed in nature is a *realisation* of the metaweb (far right side), *i.e.* the resulting network after several sorting processes have occurred (central panel). First, species and species pairs have different probabilities to be observed (top panels). Second, as a consequence of the mechanisms we outline in this paper, not all interactions have the same probability to occur at any given site (bottom panels, see **Box 1**).\label{f:meta}][f:meta]

[f:traits]: figures/fig_aggregation.pdf "Traits and populations"
![The left-hand side of this figure represents possible interactions between populations (circles) of four species (ellipses), and the aggregated species interaction network on the right. In this example, the populations and species level networks have divergent properties, and the inference on the system dynamics are likely to be different depending on the level of observation. More importantly, if the three populations highlighted in red were to co-occur, there would be no interactions between them, whereas the species-level network would predict a linear chain.\label{f:traits}][f:traits]

[f:synth]: figures/fig_synth.pdf "Synthesis"
![The approach we propose (that populations can interact at the conditions that **1** their trait allow it and **2** they are locally abundant enough for some of their individuals to meet by chance) requires an increased focus on population-level processes. A compelling argument that supports working at this level of organisation is that eco-evolutionary feedbacks are explicit. All of the components of interaction variability we described are potentially related, either through variations of population sizes due to the interaction itself, or due to selection arising from these variations in population size. In addition, some traits involved in the existence of the interaction may also affect local population abundance.\label{f:synth}][f:synth]
